Description: This is a version of the popular puzzle game Kami! In this app,
you can draw and design your own game boards in the "draw" mode. Simply select 
a color on the bottom bar, and either click or drag your mouse over the tiles 
to start drawing. To erase, select the color you want to erase and drag your 
mouse over that region. Refresh the board by hitting the refresh button.
When you're done, hit PLAY to play your own board! If you don't want to design
your own board, then take a look at the "play" mode, where you will find some 
boards that you can freely challenge yourself with! 

Click on "Compute moves" to see the fewest number of moves necessary to win the 
board in its current state, and see if you can successfully complete the 
challenge! If you get stuck, press on the hint button to get a move completed 
for you, and see if you can keep going to finish the rest of the puzzle within 
the constraints of the fewest moves needed. There are two versions of hints. The
low level hints will give you some suggestions for what moves you might want to 
try, but no guarantee that they will lead you to the shortest solution! The high
level hint button will give you the best move forward to solve the board in the 
fewest moves needed :) 

Note: you can press on the hint buttons or the compute move button in the 
middle of solving the puzzle and the program will recompute! So, if you want to
see the fewest number of moves needed to solve a puzzle from the beginning to 
end, make sure to press compute before you flood any region! 

Instructions to run the app: simply run main.py to start playing! Be sure to 
have cmu_112_graphics, Graph, and Region in the same folder as main.py.
